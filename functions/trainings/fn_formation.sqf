"A fireteam's success is often determined by its application of the right formation at the right time - failure to do so can at best lower the fireteam’s effectiveness and at the very worst cause the death of one or more of its members. 

In each formation each member is vital in carrying out its function effectively.

The formations that follow are those typically used in RCT-7."
